# i-Egress_RISK-ASSESSMENT
This is a part of the project for the CyberSecurity Risk assessment course of the Master Course in Computer Science of Trento [UNITN].

The 2 excel files contains the two qualitative risk assessments, the presentation resume some insights about the problem but it doesn't cover the entire content of the project.
